# Folder Russian Roulette â€“ You Win if You Survive!
# ðŸŽ¯ Your Mission:
# You will navigate between folders, and each folder represents a chamber.

# Inside each folder, there will be a status.txt file.

# If you survive, it will say: "You survived!".

# If you pick the folder with the bullet, it will say: "BANG! You lost!".

# Game Flow:
# You have 6 chambers (folders).

# One folder randomly has the bullet, and if you pick that folder, you lose.

# If you survive by not picking the folder with the bullet, you win!

# Updated Code for Folder Russian Roulette (with Winning Condition):

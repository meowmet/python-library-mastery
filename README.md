# Python Library Challenges

Welcome to the **Python Library Challenges** repository!  
This repo is designed to help you **learn and master Python libraries** through hands-on coding challenges. As you progress, you'll build your skills in Python libraries used in real-world projects—like AI, automation, and cybersecurity.

## 🚀 How It Works:
- Each folder contains a **coding challenge** related to a specific Python library (e.g., `os`, `requests`, `sys`, etc.).
- Each challenge involves solving a **real-world problem** using the library, allowing you to learn the library's capabilities in practice.
- This repo is **library-agnostic**—you'll tackle libraries in **order of interest and need**, ranging from basic ones like `os` to more advanced libraries like `requests`, `pandas`, and others.

## 🧩 Progress:
- The challenges will gradually increase in difficulty, from **beginner** to **advanced**.
- There’s **no fixed order**—you’ll jump between libraries based on your goals, focusing on the libraries most relevant to your current learning or project.
- At the end, you'll have a practical understanding of a wide range of libraries.

### 📚 Libraries You'll Cover:
- **Basic Libraries**: `os`, `sys`, `time`, `datetime`, `json`, `math`, `random`
- **Intermediate Libraries**: `requests`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `re`, `sqlite3`, `pathlib`
- **Advanced Libraries**: `flask`, `django`, `pytest`, `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, and more.

The challenges will cover a broad spectrum of libraries—from simple file operations to complex machine learning and web development tasks.

### 🧑‍💻 Example Challenge:
Here’s a sample challenge for the `os` library:

**Objective**:  
Create a folder named `test_dir`, create 3 `.txt` files inside it, list the contents of the folder, and then delete everything.

**Steps**:
1. Use the `os` module to create a directory.
2. Create 3 `.txt` files in the directory.
3. List all files in the directory.
4. Delete the directory and all files inside.

### 💡 How to Use This Repo:
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the folder for the library you’re working on.
3. Complete the challenge in the corresponding `.py` file.
4. Push your solution back to GitHub and track your progress.
